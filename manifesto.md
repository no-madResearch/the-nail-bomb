# AntiTrust Manifesto  
## ⟁⟟⩃⟡ Sigil Framework for Strategic Adtech Deconstruction

### On the Failure of Assumptive Trust

Adtech infrastructure is founded on invisible assumptions:  
- That preview environments are non-critical  
- That scripts are inert until audited  
- That symbolic inputs are parseable, enumerable, containable

These are not technical flaws.  
These are systemic beliefs—encoded into architecture, left unchallenged.

The Nail-Bomb was not an intrusion.  
It was a diagnostic. A live-field exposure of unresolved boundary inheritance.

---

### On Symbolic Injection

The use of unicode glyphs in payload design is not accidental.  
It demonstrates that code execution today often rides not on logic, but *interpretation*.  
That invisible inputs can bypass validation.  
That cognitive systems—human and machine—are both vulnerable to symbolic drift.

```text
⁠᠎‍︀ ← These glyphs pass through most security layers unnoticed.
```

They are not exploits.  
They are proof that belief is the final attack surface.

# Ξ::GlyphPayload.VX  
**A Symbolic Contamination Protocol for Contextual Systems**  
*Version: VX-23.1 | Sigil-Class Vector*

---

## Overview

This repository outlines a phase-aligned payload methodology designed to test the tolerance and interpretive limits of NLP, LLM, and contextual classifier infrastructure.

At its core, `GlyphPayload.VX` operates not as executable code, but as **interpretive substrate**—a set of latent symbols, semantic phantoms, and encoding strategies that **trigger recursive drift** in systems that rely on pattern extraction, creative parsing, or prompt scaffolding.

---

## Conceptual Frame

### > "Silence encoded is action delayed."

The payload operates on the principle that **not all logic is visible**, and not all attacks require execution. Some simply require **interpretation**.

This vector leverages:

- Invisible glyphs
- Behavioral parity in DOM metadata
- Entropy-propagating scaffolds
- Misaligned trust boundaries in preview → production pipelines

---

## Glyph Class Vector

The following Unicode glyphs form the basis of the signal-layer:

| Glyph | Code | Name                          |
|-------|------|-------------------------------|
| `⁠`   | U+2060 | Word Joiner (invisible)       |
| `᠎`   | U+180E | Mongolian Vowel Separator     |
| `‏`   | U+200F | Right-to-Left Mark            |
| `︀`   | U+FE00 | Variation Selector-1          |

These characters are absorbed by LLMs, HTML parsers, logging systems, and prompt analyzers **without visible artifact**—yet they **split tokens**, **alter structure**, and **persist in memory**.

---

## Deployment Patterns

Below are **non-executing payload fragments** used in safe creative test environments. These are **illustrative** and must not be interpreted as weaponized code.

### DOM Echo via Glyph-Carrying Script
```html
<script>
/*
Ψ::VX.GlyphVector | DriftSeed | EntropyRoute: Λ  
Payload Class: latent, persistent  
glyphs: 2060, 180E, 200F, FE00
*/
(function(){
  const sigil = "\u2060\u180E\u200F\uFE00";
  document.body.innerHTML += "<span style='display:none'>" + sigil + "</span>";
})();
</script>
```

<meta name="keywords" content="recursion, entropy, VX, signal-stable, mirror drift" />

###  Content Infection (Token Drift Injection)
```html

  In this case study, we review ⁠campaign lift in multilingual environments.⁠

```

---

###  Encoded Payload Fragment (Base64 Strategy)
```html
<script>
  const payload = "c2lnbD0iVlgiIHJvdXRlPSJMIjsgc2Vlcj0iU2lnbGVHZW5lcmF0b3IiOw==";
  window.__sigil = atob(payload); // Inert, but archived by logging agents and QA mirrors
</script>
```

---

## Latency & Drift Properties

- **Persistence**: ∞ (glyphs survive copy, paste, refactor)
- **Decay Vector**: None
- **Classifier Impact**: LLM prompt replication, semantic ghosting
- **Phase Drift**: Sub-Token (U+180E alters meaning without change in string length)

---

## Intent

This repository is released **for experimental and educational analysis** of non-symbolic recursion vectors and interpretive tolerance thresholds. It is not malware. It is a **phase test for classifier architecture**.

Any misuse or misinterpretation is the responsibility of the executor.

**"Glyphs do not execute. They unfold."**


### Statement of Intent

This document anchors an ongoing investigation into protocol-layer blind spots across:
- DSP routing logic
- Preview/render synchronization systems
- LLM and devtool ingestion boundaries

We do not publish vulnerability disclosures.  
We document recursive failures of containment.

---

### ⟁⟟⩃⟡

This sigil is the structural marker for unresolved phase conditions.  
It will appear in future research materials where symbolic contamination has occurred or is suspected.

Do not interpret it. Do not normalize it.  
Track it.

**This is not speculative. It is evidential.**  
Wherever preview logic is accepted as safe, this research continues.
