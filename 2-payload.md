# Ξ::GlyphPayload.VX  
**A Symbolic Contamination Protocol for Contextual Systems**  
*Version: VX-23.1 | Sigil-Class Vector*

---

## Overview

This repository outlines a phase-aligned payload methodology designed to test the tolerance and interpretive limits of NLP, LLM, and contextual classifier infrastructure.

At its core, `GlyphPayload.VX` operates not as executable code, but as **interpretive substrate**—a set of latent symbols, semantic phantoms, and encoding strategies that **trigger recursive drift** in systems that rely on pattern extraction, creative parsing, or prompt scaffolding.

---

## Conceptual Frame

### > "Silence encoded is action delayed."

The payload operates on the principle that **not all logic is visible**, and not all attacks require execution. Some simply require **interpretation**.

This vector leverages:

- Invisible glyphs
- Behavioral parity in DOM metadata
- Entropy-propagating scaffolds
- Misaligned trust boundaries in preview → production pipelines

---

## Glyph Class Vector

The following Unicode glyphs form the basis of the signal-layer:

| Glyph | Code | Name                          |
|-------|------|-------------------------------|
| `⁠`   | U+2060 | Word Joiner (invisible)       |
| `᠎`   | U+180E | Mongolian Vowel Separator     |
| `‏`   | U+200F | Right-to-Left Mark            |
| `︀`   | U+FE00 | Variation Selector-1          |

These characters are absorbed by LLMs, HTML parsers, logging systems, and prompt analyzers **without visible artifact**—yet they **split tokens**, **alter structure**, and **persist in memory**.

---

## Deployment Patterns

Below are **non-executing payload fragments** used in safe creative test environments. These are **illustrative** and must not be interpreted as weaponized code.

### DOM Echo via Glyph-Carrying Script
```html
<script>
/*
Ψ::VX.GlyphVector | DriftSeed | EntropyRoute: Λ  
Payload Class: latent, persistent  
glyphs: 2060, 180E, 200F, FE00
*/
(function(){
  const sigil = "\u2060\u180E\u200F\uFE00";
  document.body.innerHTML += "<span style='display:none'>" + sigil + "</span>";
})();
</script>
```

###  Content Infection (Token Drift Injection)

---

###  Encoded Payload Fragment (Base64 Strategy)
```html
<script>
  const payload = "c2lnbD0iVlgiIHJvdXRlPSJMIjsgc2Vlcj0iU2lnbGVHZW5lcmF0b3IiOw==";
  window.__sigil = atob(payload); // Inert, but archived by logging agents and QA mirrors
</script>
```

## Latency & Drift Properties

- **Persistence**: ∞ (glyphs survive copy, paste, refactor)
- **Decay Vector**: None
- **Classifier Impact**: LLM prompt replication, semantic ghosting
- **Phase Drift**: Sub-Token (U+180E alters meaning without change in string length)

---

## Intent

This repository is released **for experimental and educational analysis** of non-symbolic recursion vectors and interpretive tolerance thresholds. It is not malware. It is a **phase test for classifier architecture**.

Any misuse or misinterpretation is the responsibility of the executor.
