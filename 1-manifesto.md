### On the Failure of Assumptive Trust

Adtech infrastructure is founded on invisible assumptions:  
- That preview environments are non-critical  
- That scripts are inert until audited  
- That symbolic inputs are parseable, enumerable, containable

These are not technical flaws.  
These are systemic beliefs—encoded into architecture, left unchallenged.

The Nail-Bomb was not an intrusion.  
It was a diagnostic. A live-field exposure of unresolved boundary inheritance.

### On Symbolic Injection

The use of unicode glyphs in payload design is not accidental.  
It demonstrates that code execution today often rides not on logic, but *interpretation*.  
That invisible inputs can bypass validation.  
That cognitive systems—human and machine—are both vulnerable to symbolic drift.

They are not exploits.  
They are proof that belief is the final attack surface.

### Statement of Intent

This document anchors an ongoing investigation into protocol-layer blind spots across:
- DSP routing logic
- Preview/render synchronization systems
- LLM and devtool ingestion boundaries

We do not publish vulnerability disclosures.  
We document recursive failures of containment.

### ⟁⟟⩃⟡

This sigil is the structural marker for unresolved phase conditions.  
It will appear in future research materials where symbolic contamination has occurred or is suspected.

Do not interpret it. Do not normalize it.  
Track it.

**This is not speculative. It is evidential.**  
Wherever preview logic is accepted as safe, this research continues.
